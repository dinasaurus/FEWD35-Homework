Here's where you can find my comments on you work as you progress...always look for the comments.md file :)

Near perfect clone, great job! The only differences I can see are that colors are slightly off and the separators between links are a little larger since you decided to style with 'right-border' and 'divider', which is completely fine. 

For more color accuracy, try using a color selector tool to get an exact match. You can use something like Sip, or use the color picker tool in the developer tools in Google Chrome.

The last comment is that visually, your code is pretty organized...just make sure your spacing and indentation make is apparently what belongs where. For example, all the elements insdie the 'body' tag should be indented to show they are children of the 'body' tag. Later, it'll make reading your code easier for you or anyone else, especially when you need to make changes.

That's all I have for now, keep up the great work!
